# CyberSimulation

CyberSim is a cybersecurity themed simulation game based in Unity that acts as a training tool for new employees at a company to ensure that they understand security threats and how to combat them. The main gameplay features involve defending against a hacker as the chief security officer of the company. The user will be distributed random cards that contain different security measures, each with detailed descriptions once right-clicked. The gameplay loop will involve a new scenario each day where the user faces a different security threat. Information will be provided in the form of dialogue and security logs, where the user will have to select the correct options and cards in order to progress through the story. The main goal of CyberSim is to lose as little money to the security threats as possible by choosing the proper defenses. If the user loses too much money by incorrectly combating the security attack, then it is game over. This game will not only broaden the user’s experience in cybersecurity, but will also expand the user’s understanding of combating a multitude of security threats.
