# CyberSimulation

Our project involves a cybersecurity themed simulation game based in Unity that acts as a training tool for new employees at a company to ensure that they understand security threats and how to combat them. The main gameplay features involve defending against a hacker as the chief security officer of the company. The user will be distributed random cards that contain different security measures, each with detailed descriptions on their back. A skill tree will also be used to upgrade various cards, containing the core concepts of cybersecurity: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The user is given the choice to invest in these three branches, which unlock more advanced cards with better security measures, providing a better chance of combating the attack. The gameplay loop will involve a new scenario each day where the user faces a different security threat. Information in the form of dialogue and security logs will be given to the user, where they will have to select the correct options and cards to progress through the story. The main goal of CyberSim is to lose as little money to the security threats as possible by choosing the proper defenses. If the user loses too much money, then it is game over. This game will not only broaden the user’s experience in cybersecurity, but will also expand the user’s understanding of combating a multitude of security threats.
